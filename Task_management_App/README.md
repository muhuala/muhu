# 📝 Project 1 - Task Management App

## Overview

Welcome to my **To-Do List Manager** project! This application helps users organize daily tasks by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It’s a simple yet effective tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **local storage** to keep tasks saved even when the browser is closed or refreshed. This is my first big JavaScript project, where I put what I learned into practice with DOM manipulation and form handling. 

### Key Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with an input box, submitting by pressing 'Enter' or clicking an 'Add' button.
- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited directly in the list so that any task can be updated easily.
- **Delete Tasks**: Options to delete either all tasks or only the completed ones.
- **Mark as Complete**: Each task has a checkbox to mark it as done, making it easy to keep track.
- **Filter Tasks**: You can filter the list to show all, active, or completed tasks.
- **Task Count**: Keeps track of total tasks and active tasks so you know how much is left to do.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved using local storage, so they’re still there even after closing or refreshing the browser.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the app.
- **styles.css**: Handles the CSS styling to make the app user-friendly and nice to look at.
- **script.js**: Where all the JavaScript magic happens, covering:
  - Adding, editing, and deleting tasks
  - Updating the DOM in real-time
  - Saving and loading tasks from local storage
  - Validating user input to prevent duplicates or errors

## Self-Project Evaluation

### General Evaluation
This project was a rewarding experience in creating a JavaScript application from scratch. Here’s my assessment against the project criteria:

| Evaluation Criteria    | My Thoughts |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Functionality**      | I believe the application fully meets functional requirements. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks smoothly. |
| **Data Persistence**   | I implemented local storage effectively, so tasks are saved between sessions, creating a smooth user experience. |
| **User Interface**     | The UI is clean and intuitive, with well-placed buttons and labels that guide users without overwhelming them. |
| **Error Handling**     | I included input validation to prevent users from adding tasks with less than three characters, starting with a number, or duplicating a task. |
| **Responsiveness**     | The app adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile. |
| **Efficiency**         | I optimized DOM updates, only updating elements that changed to maintain performance as the task list grows. |
| **Accessibility**      | The app is keyboard-accessible, with labels and visual contrast to improve readability for all users. |
| **Innovation**         | While traditional, I added features like filtering, which enhances the classic to-do list by allowing users to organize and view tasks easily. |

### Challenges and Learnings
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to efficiently update and handle large lists without slowing down the app.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented more robust validation than I initially planned, which really improved the user experience.
- **Storage and Persistence**: Practiced using local storage to retain data, which added a lot of value to the app.
- **Responsive Design**: Gained experience with media queries to ensure the app is usable across various devices.

### Final Self-Grade
Based on the evaluation criteria, I would grade myself as follows:

- **Completion of Functional Requirements**: 9/10
- **Data Persistence**: 9/10
- **User Interface**: 9/10
- **Responsiveness**: 10/10
- **Accessibility**: 8/10
- **Overall Score**: 45/50
## Summary
Based on the project requirements, I believe my project falls into the **Very Good to Excellent range** (25-30 points). The To-Do List Manager meets all essential requirements and incorporates dynamic, user-focused features, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

### Final Notes
This project was a great hands-on experience in creating a full JavaScript application. It reinforced the importance of **data persistence**, **user interface design**, and **input validation**. I’m excited to continue building on these skills in future projects!
